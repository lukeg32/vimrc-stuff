the code necessary for adding the vimrc_java.vim is the block
surrounded by """""
also source will have to be changed to the location of the vimrc_java file

feel free to look at the other stuff in my vimrc and steal it

todo:
make the importer have some regex
make importer place imports above class/interface delcaration instead of assuming there is a header
